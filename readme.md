In this lab, you will be using the [Sakila](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/) database of movie rentals. Create appropriate joins wherever necessary. 

### Instructions

1. How many copies of the film _Hunchback Impossible_ exist in the inventory system?
2. List all films whose length is longer than the average of all the films.

4. Sales have been lagging among young families, and you wish to target all family movies for a promotion. Identify all movies categorized as family films.
5. Get name and email from customers from Canada using subqueries. Do the same with joins. Note that to create a join, you will have to identify the correct tables with their primary keys and foreign keys, that will help you get the relevant information.
